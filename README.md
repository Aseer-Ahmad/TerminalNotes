# TerminalNotes
Small python script run using Terminal alias for ubuntu linux.
No GUI notes for linux are comparable to the Windows [Sticky notes].

This script provides an easy trip to take notes and manage them on terminals itself.
As easy and simple as Ctrl+Alt+T and write "note".
That's it.

This beginner script would provide to:
1. Search through files based on names
2. Search through content based on keywords

Now, for one to be able to use this.
We simply have to add a $PATH to .bashrc file.

One can accomplish this by using the helper.py.   
But before running it, keep both the scripts at the same location.

Now open your terminal and run helper.py
$ python helper.py
